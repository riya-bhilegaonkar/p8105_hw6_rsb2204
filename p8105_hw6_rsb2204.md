### Problem 1

### Problem 2

Creating a `city_state` variable and a binary variable `resolved` to
indicate whether a homicide is solved. Filtering for cities that do not
include Dallas(TX), Phoenix(AZ), Kansas City(MO) and Tulsa(AL) and
filtering for the victim race of white or black. The `victim_age`
variable is changed to a numeric variable.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,state, sep=", "), resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))%>%
  filter(city_state !="Dallas, TX" | city_state !="Phoenix, AZ" | city_state!="Kansas City, MO", victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"))%>%
  select(city_state, victim_sex, resolved, victim_age, victim_race)
```

``` r
homicide_data %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(is.na(victim_age)))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   290

For the city of Baltimore, MD we use the `glm` function to fit a
logistic regression with resolved vs unsolved as the outcome and victim
age, sex and race as predictors, saving the results as an R object.

``` r
fit_logistic = homicide_data %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")%>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data =., family = binomial()) 
```

Displaying the estimate and the confidence interval of the adjusted odds
ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims
keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
fit_logistic %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>% 
   filter(term=="victim_sexMale")%>%
  mutate(CI.low = exp(conf.low), CI.high = exp(conf.high))%>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, CI.low, CI.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           | log_OR |    OR | CI.low | CI.high |
|:---------------|-------:|------:|-------:|--------:|
| victim_sexMale | -0.854 | 0.426 |  0.324 |   0.558 |

As this is a logistic regression we must remember to convert our OR back
to an exponential from its log value and to do the same for the
confidence interval values which we do using mutate().

Running a `glm` for each city in the dataset and extracting the adjusted
odds ratio and CI for solving homicides comparing male victims to female
victims. Creating a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city:

``` r
citiesOR_df = homicide_data %>%
  nest(data=-city_state)%>%
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_race + victim_sex + victim_age, data=.x, family = binomial()), na.action="na.exclude"),
    results = map(models, ~broom::tidy(x=.x, conf.int=T))) %>%
  select(-data, -models)%>%
  unnest(results)%>%
mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
    filter(term=="victim_sexMale")%>%
  mutate(CI.low = exp(conf.low), CI.high = exp(conf.high))%>%
  select(city_state, term, log_OR = estimate, OR, CI.low, CI.high)
```

Plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city:

``` r
citiesOR_df %>%
mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR))%>%
ggplot(aes(x=city_state, y=OR))+
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=CI.low, ymax=CI.high))
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_rsb2204_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

From the plot we see that New York has the lowest odds ratio for solving
homicides comparing male to female victims. The adjusted odds ratio is
below 1 for the majority of cities which means the odds of solving a
homicide in female victims is higher than in male victims. Albuquerque
has the highest odds ratio where the estimated odds of a homicide being
solved where there is male victim is 1.67 times the odds of a homicide
being solved where there is a female victim. It is interesting to see
these results as the majority of homicide victims are men.

### Problem 3

Loading and cleaning the data for regression analysis:

``` r
birthweight = 
   read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(babysex = recode(
    babysex,
    "1" = "male",
    "2" = "female"
  ),
  frace = recode(
    frace,
    "1" = "White",
    "2" = "Black",
    "3" = "Asian",
    "4" = "Puerto Rican",
    "8" = "Other",
    "9" = "Unknown"
  ),
  malform = recode(
    malform,
    "0" = "absent",
    "1" = "present"
  ),
  mrace = recode(
    mrace,
    "1" = "White",
    "2" = "Black",
    "3" = "Asian",
    "4" = "Puerto Rican",
    "8" = "Other"
  )
  )
```

    ## Rows: 4342 Columns: 20
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (20): babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malf...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The birthweight dataset contains information that allows us to
understand the effects of several variable such as a baby’s sex, head
circumference at birth, length at birth, birth weight, mother’s weight
at delivery, family monthly income etc on a child’s birthweight. We
first clean the data using `janitor::clean_names()`. For the purpose of
our regression analysis, we convert the variables of `babysex`,
frace`,`malform`, and`mrace\` to factor variables. They are present in
the intial dataset as categorical variables and their numeric coded
values are not as intuitive to analysis as the recoded factor variables
would be.

Checking for missing values:

``` r
birthweight%>%
  summarise(N_A = sum(is.na(birthweight)))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##     N_A
    ##   <int>
    ## 1     0

From the tibble we see that there appears to be no missing values in the
data.

We will use stepwise regression to determine an ideal regression model
for birthweight:

``` r
all_lm <- lm(bwt~., data=birthweight)

backward <- step(all_lm, direction='backward', scope=formula(all_lm), trace=0)

summary(backward)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + 
    ##     gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data = birthweight)

Steps of Modelling process: In order to chose the variables for our
model, we use the stepwise approach which compares successive models and
identifies the best subsets. For my model I used backward elimination.
For this I first started with all the predictions in the model and then
removed the predictors with the highest p-value (p-value) (those which
are not significant \<0.05). The `step()` with the direction of
‘backward’ function performs this analysis as it continues to re-fit the
model and remove the next least significant predictor. The end results
of the `step()`, the summary for the anova, shows which variables need
to be removed from the model.

``` r
backward[["anova"]]

From these results we see that the variables of `wtgain`, `pnumsga`,
`pnumlbw`, `frace`, `malform`, `ppbmi`, `momage`, and `menarche` can be
removed from our model. Looking at the p-values we see that `babysex`,
`bhead`, `blength`, `delwt`, `fincome`, `gaweeks`, `mheight`, `mrace`,
`parity`, `ppwt` and `smoken` are significant at an alpha = 0.05
significance level and we will include these predictors in our model.

Using stepwise backward the chosen model is regression model is, this
will be my proposed regression model:

``` r
birthweight_lm <- lm(bwt~babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data=birthweight)

Comparing the proposed regression model against two others:

1)  One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
    effects only)

``` r
model1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data=birthweight)
```

2)  One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
    (including the three-way interaction) between these

``` r
model2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*blength, data=birthweight)
```

Using cross-validated prediction errors to make the comparison:

``` r
cv_df =
  modelr::crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))
```

``` r
cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    birthweight_lm  = map(train, ~lm(bwt~babysex + bhead + blength + delwt + fincome + gaweeks + mheight + mrace + parity + ppwt + smoken, data=.x)),
    model1    = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data=.x)),
    model2  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*blength, data=.x))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_birthweight = map2_dbl(birthweight_lm, test, ~modelr::rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model1    = map2_dbl(model1, test, ~modelr::rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model2 = map2_dbl(model2, test, ~modelr::rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>%
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_rsb2204_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="90%" />

From these results there is clearly an improvement in predictive
accuracy gained through my proposed regression model in comparison to
model 1 and model 2, as my model produces the lowest cross validated
prediction error. In terms of ranking from lowest to highest prediction
error it would first be my model, then model 2, then model 1.
